# Data-Management-with-a-Hash-Table
The program was written i C language to store data in a Hash table. Program is was able to handle any collision of data by applying open addressing. 


How to run the Code:                                                                                                                                                                               
1- Download and Open the Data Management with a Hash Table.c                                                                                                                                                            2- Run the Code.                                                                                                                                                                                         
3- User Input:
    - If the user enters 1, linear probing will be used where f(i) = i
    - If the user enters 2, quadratic probing will be used where f(i) = i2
    -If the user enters 3, double hashing will be used where f(i) = i * hash2(x)
